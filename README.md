ECOT (or, Eukyre's Consortium of Things) is an all-in-one mod in which I will be adding most of my future content that isn't set-up for Echoes of Tarkov, or my other standalone mods; as such you can expect to find a wide variety of items in this mod, from Glocks to specific Shark Plushies (Yes, they're back.)
